# Preparing BIM data for meaningful visualisations

This will be an introduction into the open-source tool: Speckle; How it works and how it can be integrated into Rhino and Grasshopper and will examine the processing of BIM information generated from the day to day to generate and sort meaningful metrics to aid in better decision making. The session will be focused on combining the flexibility of grasshopper and capturing all the information generated into a singular place to view and compare data.

# Workshop

The final output will be a series of models with varying degrees of metadata attached to the geometry themselves. Shown Below

This interactive workshop will go over the benefits of using speckle to attach information to your grasshopper models, and the proper way to set up your model so you can then view the results on the speckle website.

The final solution can be found within this repo.
